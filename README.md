<!-- ## What I am up to right now ðŸ”­ 
- I am working on a research project **AidUI** - a novel automated approach for detecting deceptive
UI designs to protect users from designs with malicious intent, and guide the developers in complying with the ethical design principles -->

<!-- ## What Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸŒ±
- I am exploring, learning & trying to get a solid foundation in the domain of Deep Learning.  Currently, I am reading the online book [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html). -->

<!-- Currently I am doing the Udemy course [PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-for-deep-learning-with-python-bootcamp/). In parallel, -->
<!-- 
- To get myself better in the Software Architecture domain, I am currently reading the book **Microservices: From Design to Deployment** *by Chris Richardson
with Floyd Smith* -->

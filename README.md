### Hi folks  👋
I am Hasan, a CS Grad student & Teaching Assistant at George Mason University, USA. Before moving to the grad school, I had the opportuity to work as a Software Engineer in different tech stack for around 5 years. I know my fair share of languages, Python & JS are the ones I use the most.

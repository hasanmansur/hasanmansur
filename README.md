### Hi folks, this is Hasan  👋
- Currently a CS grad student & Teaching Assistant @George Mason University
- Focused, pragmatic & result oriented individual with professional experience in Software Development
- Experienced in different programming languages including Python, Javascript & Java
- Conversant with building RESTful application backend with Node.js/Express.js in a microservices architecture
- Competent in MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Docker
- Familiar with standard development practices like Version Control, TDD & Cloud technologies (AWS)
- Passionate about building deep learning models. Good working knowledge with PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, pandas

I enjoy working for solving real life problems, and not opinionated on tools and technology stack. I am a self motivated & well organized team player. When I am not working - I am a complete family man. I like to watch movies, read books and play with my kid :-)

## What I am up to right now 🔭
I am working on developing the follwoing projects:
- [Mukh-O-Mukhosh (Bengali: মুখ ও মুখোশ)](https://github.com/hasanmansur/Mukh-O-Mukhosh) a Convolutional Neural Network model for Face Mask Detection
<!--- [KheroKhata (Bengali: খেরোখাতা)](https://github.com/hasanmansur/KheroKhata) a Microservice boilerplate project to demonstrate different Software Engineering & Architecture aspects like *Microservice Architecture, REST api, Asynchronous Communication, Message Queueing, TDD, Containerization, CI/CD* 
-->
<!-- - [Drishtipat (Bengali: দৃষ্টিপাত)](https://github.com/hasanmansur/Drishtipat) a collection of programs to demonstrate various Computer Vision concepts/topics like *Image Transformations, Histogram Analysis, Gradients, Edge Detection, Feature Extraction, Curvature & Distance Transform Computation, Chamfer matching, Stereo Matching, Disparity, Belief Propagation*
-->
## What I’m currently learning 🌱
- I am exploring, learning & trying to get a solid foundation in the domain of Deep Learning. Currently I am doing the Udemy course [PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-for-deep-learning-with-python-bootcamp/). In parallel, I am reading the book [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html).
<!-- 
- To get myself better in the Software Architecture domain, I am currently reading the book **Microservices: From Design to Deployment** *by Chris Richardson
with Floyd Smith* -->

### Hi folks  üëã
I am Hasan, a CS Grad student & Teaching Assistant at George Mason University, USA. Before moving to the grad school, I had the opportuity to work as a Software Engineer in different tech stack for around 5 years. I know my fair share of languages, Python & JS are the ones I use the most.

## What I am up to right now üî≠
I am working on developing the follwoing projects:
- [Mukh-O-Mukhosh (Bengali: ‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶ñ ‡¶ì ‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶ñ‡ßã‡¶∂)](https://github.com/hasanmansur/Mukh-O-Mukhosh) a Convolutional Neural Network model for Face Mask Detection
- [KheroKhata (Bengali: ‡¶ñ‡ßá‡¶∞‡ßã‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶æ)](https://github.com/hasanmansur/KheroKhata) a Microservice boilerplate project to demonstrate different Software Engineering & Architecture aspects like *Microservice Architecture, REST api, Asynchronous Communication, Message Queueing, TDD, Containerization, CI/CD* 
- [Drishtipat (Bengali: ‡¶¶‡ßÉ‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶§)](https://github.com/hasanmansur/Drishtipat) a collection of programs to demonstrate various Computer Vision concepts/topics like *Image Transformations, Histogram Analysis, Gradients, Edge Detection, Feature Extraction, Curvature & Distance Transform Computation, Chamfer matching, Stereo Matching, Disparity, Belief Propagation*

## What I‚Äôm currently learning üå±
- I am exploring, learning & trying to get a solid foundation in the domain of Deep Learning. Currently I am doing the Udemy course [PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-for-deep-learning-with-python-bootcamp/). In parallel, I am reading the book [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html).

- To get myself better in the Software Architecture domain, I am currently reading the book **Microservices: From Design to Deployment** *by Chris Richardson
with Floyd Smith*
